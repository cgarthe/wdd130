    <h1>Project Reflection Report</h1>

    <h2>1. Client Report</h2>
    <p>The site was created for a clothing brand. Content and images were based on designs I created myself to reflect the brand’s aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Communication with the developer was through Microsoft Teams, though contact was limited at times. Despite this, the developer met my expectations. Next time, I would collaborate more closely to ensure my vision is realized.</p>

    <h2>2. Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I led a team of two junior developers, dividing tasks by page. Communication within the team and with the client via Teams was clear. The site was published using GitHub Pages and shared with the client through Teams.</p>
    <p>GitHub was a little tricky at first, but I managed branches and pull requests successfully by the end.</p>

    <h2>3. Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I communicated with team leads through Teams. Instructions were clear, and I understood my tasks, which included HTML structure, CSS styling, and layout fixes. I felt my contributions were meaningful as I saw my work reflected in the final sites.</p>
    <p>GitHub presented no major issues beyond minor delays pushing changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Site Links:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://acater8585.github.io/wdd130-Calcote/builds.html" target="_blank">https://acater8585.github.io/wdd130-Calcote/builds.html</a></li>
        <li>Another site is pending access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. General Experience & Reflections</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part was managing multiple teams at once. I overcame this by reaching out to teammates for clarification. I enjoyed seeing the final products come to life and, if I could do it again, I would arrange in-person meetings for better collaboration.</p>
    <p>This experience increased my confidence in real-world projects and teamwork, giving me a clearer understanding of project coordination and collaboration.</p>
